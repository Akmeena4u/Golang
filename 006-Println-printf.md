In Go, the `fmt` package provides functionalities for formatted input and output. Two commonly used functions for output are `Println` and `Printf`. Here's a breakdown of each:

### `Println`

The `Println` function in Go is used to print values to the standard output (usually the console) with a newline character (`\n`) added at the end. Its syntax is straightforward:

```go
fmt.Println(a, b, c, ...)
```

- `a`, `b`, `c`, etc., are the values or variables to be printed.
- Each value is separated by a space in the output.
- A newline character is automatically added at the end of the output.

Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    name := "Alice"
    age := 30
    fmt.Println("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
}
```

Output:
```
Name: Alice Age: 30
```

### `Printf`

The `Printf` function in Go is used for formatted printing. It allows you to specify the format of the output using format verbs (placeholders). Its syntax is:


Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    name := "Bob"
    age := 25
    salary := 50000.50
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Salary: $%.2f\n", name, age, salary)
}
```

Output:
```
Name: Bob, Age: 25, Salary: $50000.50
```


### Formatting Verbs

Here are some commonly used format verbs in Go:

- `%v`: Default format.
- `%d`: Integer format.
- `%f`: Floating-point format.
- `%s`: String format.
- `%t`: Boolean format.
- `%x`: Hexadecimal format.

You can combine these verbs with additional formatting options. For example, `%10s` specifies a string with a minimum width of 10 characters.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    num := 123
    fmt.Printf("Decimal: %d, Hexadecimal: %x, Binary: %b\n", num, num, num)
}
```

Output:
```
Decimal: 123, Hexadecimal: 7b, Binary: 1111011
```

These are the basics of `Println` and `Printf` in Go. They are powerful tools for formatting and displaying output in various ways.
